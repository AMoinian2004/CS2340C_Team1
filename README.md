## Contributions
As the Programming Lead and Full Stack Programmer, I led a team of five developers by reviewing over 80 pull requests and practicing agile methodology. I used Firebase Firestore to store over 200 player scores to the leaderboard backend and created an adaptive UI for the frontend. I also improved app performance by 25% through refactoring 35% of the codebase and decreasing the use of costly code handlers.
